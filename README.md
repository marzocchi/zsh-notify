zsh-notify
===

Desktop notifications for long-running commands in ZSH.

Supported terminals and requirements
---

:warning: **iTerm2 user?** If you don't need support for other terminal have a look at
this new project â†’ [iterm-notify](https://github.com/marzocchi/iterm-notify/).

- On macOS: Terminal.app or [iTerm2][iterm2];
- On Linux (and possibly other systems): any terminal application should be
  supported as `xdotool` and `wmctrl` are used to query and modify windows
  state.
  
When using the default configuration, notifications are posted using
[terminal-notifier.app][terminal-notifier] on macOS and `notify-send` on
other systems; usage of custom notifier is described in [Configuration](#configuration).

When using Tmux on Yosemite, `reattach-to-user-namespace` is required to
prevent terminal-notifier to hang (see
[julienXX/terminal-notifier#115][issue115] for details).

Installation and usage
---

Just clone this repository and source `notify.plugin.zsh` in your `~/.zshrc`,
or see below for instructions on installing with some popular package managers.

Configuration
---

The behavior of zsh-notify can be modified by using `zstyle` **after**
sourcing `notify.plugin.zsh`.

- Set a custom title for error and success notifications, when using the
  built-in notifier.

        zstyle ':notify:*' error-title "Command failed"
        zstyle ':notify:*' success-title "Command finished"

    The string `#{time_elapsed}` will be replaced with the command run time.

        zstyle ':notify:*' error-title "Command failed (in #{time_elapsed} seconds)"
        zstyle ':notify:*' success-title "Command finished (in #{time_elapsed} seconds)"

- Change the notifications icons for failure or success. Provide the path to an
  image, or an URL if you are on macOS.
        
        zstyle ':notify:*' error-icon "/path/to/error-icon.png"
        zstyle ':notify:*' success-icon "/path/to/success-icon.png"
    
    [Try this][dogefy.sh]. Wow.

- Play sounds with error and success notifications when using the built-in
  notifier. Provide the path to an audio file, or the name of an "alert" sound
  if you are on macOS.

        zstyle ':notify:*' error-sound "Glass"
        zstyle ':notify:*' success-sound "default"

- Have the terminal come back to front when the notification is posted.

        zstyle ':notify:*' activate-terminal yes

- Disable setting the urgency hint for the terminal when the notification is
  posted (Linux only).

        zstyle ':notify:*' disable-urgent yes

- Set a different timeout for notifications for successful commands
  (notifications for failed commands are always posted).

        zstyle ':notify:*' command-complete-timeout 15

   The default value is 30 seconds.

- Replace the built-in notifier with a custom one at `~/bin/my-notifier`. The
  custom notifier will receive the notification type (`error` or `success`) as
  the first argument, the time elapsed as the second argument, and the
  command line as standard input.

        zstyle ':notify:*' notifier ~/bin/my-notifier

- Use the time elapsed even when the command fails (by default, notifications
  for command failures are not conditional on the elapsed time).

        zstyle ':notify:*' always-notify-on-failure no

- Set a blacklist of commands that should never trigger notifications, using a
  regex support by grep's extended regular expression syntax:

        zstyle ':notify:*' blacklist-regex 'find|git'

- Enable when connected over SSH, which is disabled by default.

        zstyle ':notify:*' enable-on-ssh yes

- Disable error reporting (or send it somewhere else)

        zstyle ':notify:*' error-log /dev/null

- Force checking of the `WINDOWID` variable on every command:

        zstyle ':notify:*' always-check-active-window yes

## Installation with package managers

### [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

Add `antigen bundle marzocchi/zsh-notify` to your `.zshrc` with your other
bundle commands.

Antigen will handle cloning the plugin for you automatically the next time you
start zsh. You can also add the plugin to a running zsh with `antigen bundle
marzocchi/zsh-notify` for testing before adding it to your `.zshrc`.

### [Oh-My-Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)

1. `git clone git@github.com:marzocchi/zsh-notify.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/notify`
2. Add zsh-notify to your plugin list - edit `~./zshrc` and change `plugins=(...)` to `plugins=(... notify)`

**Note:** when cloning, specify the target directory as `notify` since
Oh-My-Zsh expects the plugin's initialization file to have the same name as
it's directory.

### [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)

Add `zgen load marzocchi/zsh-notify` to your .zshrc file in the same function
you're doing your other `zgen load` calls in.
